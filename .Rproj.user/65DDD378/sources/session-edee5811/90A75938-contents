## Abstract

Mein Kaffeee? No, Mi Café: Expropriation and Property Right Enforcement in 20th Century Guatemala

Despite the pivotal role of German immigrants in developing Guatemala's coffe industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two distinct periods - World War I (1914-1918) under Manuel Estrada Cabrera's rule (1898-1920) and World War II during Jorge Ubico's leadership (1931-1944) - witnessed the expropriation, redistribution, and nationalization of German-owned properties. Notably, the outcomes of these expropriations differed; while Estrada Cabrera's seized land was eventually restored, Ubico's expropriations endured across subsequent administrations.

In light of coffee's critical role in Guatemala's modernization and the significant impact of German immigrants, this paper advances a theory of property rights enforcement within developing states. This theory is then applied to a comparative analysis of the these two expropriation cases, seeking to answer the question: how do expropriation strategies shape property rights enforcement in developing states?


## Mein Kaffee: Property Rights and Expropriation in developing States 

How are property rights enforced in developing states? 


During the first half of the 20th century, Guatemala emerged as a prominent coffee exporter in the global market, with the growth of the country's coffee sector being largely attributed to the involvement of Germany. While the introduction of coffee by the Spanish in the 17th century laid the foundation, it was the late 19th-century influx of German immigrants injected the necessary capital for large-scale coffee production in the region. German immigrants not only introduced advanced cultivation methods, but also undertook infrastructure projects-building roads, railroads, and establishing market connections-that facilitated the widespread export of coffee. The growth of coffee exports went hand in hand with the development and modernization of the Guatemalan state given that fiscal revenue was primarily reliant on taxes on imports, exports, and liquor; with Germans not only playing a role in the export of coffee, but the importation of German goods.  

The German's role in shaping the Guatemalan coffee industry began with the granting of land titles to the Belgian Colonization Company in 1842, leading to the arrival of forty-eight Germans. Although the Santo Tomas colony under Barnon von Bulow's directorship faltered within five years, these efforts to exploit economic opportunities in conjunction with a failed revolutionary attempt in Germany (1848) and unfavorable economic conditions led to a significant migration of Germans to both Guatemala and the broader Latin American region. 

This migration pattern allowed for the succesful establishment German coffee capitalists, particularly in the Alta Verapaz region. Encouraged by fiscal policies that promoted coffee exports, the 1878 treaty between [blank] that led to the eventual signing of the 1887 *Tratado de Amistad Comercio y Navegacion y Convención Consular*, further solidified economic and political rights for Germans in the region. The 1887 treaty is argued to be a critical juncture for Guatemala and German relations now that it bestowed freedom of movement, property ownership, and participation in commercial enterprises upon German immigrants. These economic rights alongside political rights allowed for Germans to exploit the commercial opportunities given to them and visible in coffee export figures. In the two decades between 1880 and 1900, Guatemala witnessed an astonishing rise in coffee exports, escalating from 289,762 *quintales* (equivalent to 289,762,000 kilos) in 1880, to 694,817 *quintales* in 1900, a surge that mirrored Guatemala's increased integration into international markets. 

Despite the crucial role of Germans in the advancement of Guatemalan coffee, two significant periods - World War I (1914-1918) during Manuel Estrada Cabrera's dictatorship (1898-1920) and World War II under Jorge Ubico's rule (1931-1944)--witnessed the expropriation, redistribution, and nationalization of German owned properties. Notably, the effects of these expropriations differed substantially, while the land seized by Estrada Cabrera was eventually returned, Ubico's expropriations persisted into successive administrations.  Given the importance of coffee to Guatemala and the role of German immigrants to its development it raises the questions: what were the differences in incentives that led to restitution in one case further expropriation in the other? More importantly ***how are property rights enforced in developing states?*** 

Property rights are bundles of rights over a resource defining ownership, permissible use, and exchangeability. Within society, these bundles of rights introduce a discriminatory dynamic by clearly delineating who is allowed to claim a resource and how they can use it (Alchian 1965). Enforced through third party mechanisms (Barzel 2002), ranging from informal and *de facto* methods, such as norms and customs (Murtazashvili and Murtazashvili 2021, 91-119), to formal and *de jure* mechanisms using state power (North 1990, 7), property rights influence the flow of entrepreneurship and economic resources within a society (Pejovich 1990, 103). 

Due to the influence property rights have on both the flow of entrepreneurship and economic resources, their enforcement are deemed as necessary for economic development. On the spectrum of private to public good the closer property rights are enforced in a manner that is nonrivalrous, nonexcludable, and accessible to individuals participating in a country's economy, the closer these countries are to having wealth maximizing or socially optimal outcomes (North 1986; Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; 2019). 

Despite the social optimality of property rights when enforced as a public good, developing states tend to fall short when it comes to the ideal enforcement of rights due to two factors. The first, the lack of state capacity to enforce property rights as a public good and the second, the purposeful or deliberate enforcement of property rights as a private good. 

Where state capacity consists of the ability for states to both gather revenue and use this revenue for the provision of public goods (Candela 2020). Issues involving political instability (Besley and Persson 2009), and risk of conflict from domestic and international actors (Besley and Persson 2010), negatively influence a developing state from making long-term investments in the institutions necessary for political modernization, increased state capacity, and hindering the enforcement of property rights in the process. Shortcomings in property right enforcement may also be purposeful when property rights enforcement is used as a political tool and for political control (Murtazasvhili and Murtazashvili 2016; Albertus 2020a, 90). When states purposefully decide not to enforce property rights as a public good, private actors are forced to interact with the state and exchange political rents for the enforcement of their property rights. 

The comparative analysis of Guatemala and expropriation under the regimes of Cabrera Estrada and Ubico focuses on the strategic decisions to not enforce property rights as a public good. Diverging from the portrayal of the state as a stationary bandit that assumes the enforcement of property rights as a public good across regime types (Olson 1993; McGuire and Olson 1996), but instead building on the idea of the stationary bandit as a discriminatory monopolist in the enforcement of property rights (North 1986). The interpretation of the state in this paper is that of a stationary bandit who purposefully decides to enforce the property rights of some private actors over others (Haber, Maurer, and Razo 2003). When applied to the study of autocracies it is possible to understand that autocrats use expropriation as a tool to reconfigure a society's economic and political power dynamics, consolidating autocratic authority and prolonging their rule (Albertus and Menaldo 2012).


To advance this understanding of the relationship of property right enforcement this paper is presented in the following manner. Section II develops a theory of expropriation in developing autocracies. Building on the assumption of the stationary bandit as a discriminatory monopolist in the enforcement of property rights, and arguing that states enforce property rights in a discriminatory manner in order to see increases in revenue or as a tool for expansion in their ability to use state power indiscriminately. Given limitations created

## Towards a theory of property right enforcement in developing states

The theory this paper builds off of one assumption: all states aim to see increases in revenue. A simple utility maximizing argument, noting that given the opportunity between having more or less revenue all states and state actors will choose to have more over less revenue. Since a state aims to see increases in revenue it must enforce property rights in a way that will allow for this increase. However, the enforcement of property rights is not cost free and as a result of the state's desire to see increases in revenue, it will not enforce property rights in a socially optimal manner - but instead until the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit of enforcement. In addition to property rights not being enforced as socially optimal, developing states lack the state capacity to enforce property rights as a public good. Given that a developing state does not have the state capacity to enforce property rights in a non-excludable and non-rivalrous manner the provision of property rights by a developing state will be as a private good. 

Given that property rights will not be enforced in a socially optimal manner and are also enforced as a private good, in countries with developing states, state actors will act as discriminatory monopolists in the enforcement of property rights. In these countries and under these states, there are property rights for some, but not for all. This dynamic is observed in the literature on property rights and state capacity in developing states, as well as when taking both Central American and Latin American history into account. 

Analyses of modernization in the global north support the observation that despite the evolution of property rights to be more representative of a public over a private good, at one point in time property rights in these countries and societies were enforced in a discriminatory fashion and as a private good for local elites (Salter 2015; Candela 2020; Geloso and Salter 2020; Piano and Salter 2021). Research on the global south note how limitations regarding a state's ability to provide property rights due to a lack of capacity leads to the emergence of elite capture of property enforcing institutions, resulting in the discriminatory enforcement of property rights in these countries (Murtazashvili and Murtazashvili 2016a; 2016b; 2019a; 2019b; 2020; 2021, ch. 3 ). 

The property right enforcement dynamics in both the global north and south are visible in colonial and postcolonial Latin American history. During the conquista and colonial period property right policies tended to favor Spanish settlers over *criollos* (of Spanish descent but born in Latin America), *mestizos* (born in Latin America of a Spanish and Indigenous parent), indigenous, and Afro-descendent peoples. Beginning with the *Encomienda*, the Spanish Crown granted Spanish settlers not only rights to exploit newly discovered land, but the ability to extract forced labor and tribute from Indigenous populations. As a reaction to the brutality and cruelty of the Encomienda (see. de las Casas 1552), reform surrounding property rights surrounded the *Repartimiento* which aimed to limit the extent of indigenous exploitation, but allowed for the exploitation of land and natural resources in the region. Unlike *repartimientos* that focused on particular projects, *haciendas* were granted to *hacendados* with grants of land given to Spanish settlers with the purpose of exploiting agricultural and livestock raising opportunities.

With the majority of Latin American countries gaining independence in the first half of the 19th century, the extent of property ownership and property right enforcement continued being dependent on political connections after Spanish rule. In Central America, countries with stronger conservative presence, such as Guatemala and El Salvador, property institutions and property enforcement aimed at protecting the interests of political elites. In Costa Rica where conservative presence was weaker, states encouraged homesteading and adopted more inclusive property right policies, however the merchant class that largely dominated the political landscape of the country also owned the large haciendas in the country - with 19th century political instability being influenced by the political power constantly disputed by these landowners. Alongside the first wave of liberalism later in the 19th century came land and agricultural reform, these policies did not aim to increase economic participation as a whole - but only increased the participation of certain individuals within the country. The expropriation and privatization of land and property owned by the Catholic church, these policies further exacerbated the exclusion and participation of indigenous populations. While privatization and redistribution of these lands aimed to exclude portions of the population form participating in the regions' economy, other policies aimed to integrate additional actors into their countries' economies. The result of these preferences were policies and concessions granted to foreign private actors and foreign investment, encouraging the landowning of and influx of capital from these actors. 

Despite existing literature supporting the discriminatory enforcement of property rights with the purpose of increasing state revenue and being optimal for the state instead of the country as a whole, solely focusing on the desire for revenue ignores the inherent political dynamic in the enforcement of property rights and potential breadth of of analysis. If solely focusing on the enforcement of rights as a means to see increases in revenue, it raises questions regarding why political actors do not act in a way consistent with this. The case of 19th century expropriation of Church lands in Guatemala illustrates this. Yes, the *liberales* aim to exploit the economic opportunities of privatizing this land, but at the same time this redistribution was used as a tool to weaken the influence of not only the Church but the land owning *conservadores* (conservatives). Although a failed attempt at doing so the *federalistas* in Venezuela under General Ezequiel Zamora (1859-1860) attempted to implement land policy with the intent of redistributing land to peasants, not only to garner support among rural Venezuelans but to weaken centralist landowning elites. Additional instances include the abolition of slavery in Brazil 1888, where not only were slaves granted freedom, but land was expropriated from slave holding elites in order to weaken their political influence. 

Due to cases where state actors do not aim to act in a way that solely maximizes revenue, it is necessary to include an assumption that acknowledges the political components of property right enforcement. Given the importance of doing so the following assumption is possible: once in power, political leaders and state actors aim to remain in office. In autocracies this is visible with dictators attempting to find ways to remain in power, while in democracies although there may be changes in the executive, political parties aim to keep a candidate in office or majorities in other (non-judiciary) branches of government. Political actors will enforce property rights in a way to increase political support and stay in power. Whether this be through the granting of new property rights, refusal to enforce existing rights, and in the most extreme case expropriation. Property rights play an important role in political survival - because they establish who can participate in economic decision making. In cases where property rights are granted, actors can now participate in a particular industry, and in turn see increases in wealth that lead to increases in government revenue. While in cases of expropriation, the ability to see increases in revenue through economic decision making is taken away, leading to a decrease in wealth and with the decrease in wealth the ability of a particular actor's ability to use this wealth to challenge a political leader. Finally political leaders want to avoid cases where property rights are either continued to be enforced or granted to an actor who with existing wealth will challenge political survival. 

The primary assumptions of this paper have two components, an economic component and a political component. The economic component acknowledges that state enforced property rights are not enforced with the purpose of being socially optimal, but instead with the purpose of there being increases in government revenue. Since, the enforcement of property rights is not cost free, then property rights will be enforced in a discriminatory manner, given that some private actors can produce more revenue than others with the enforcement of their property rights. This leads to property right enforcement being closer to that of a private over a public good. The political component assumes that property rights are enforced by the state with the purpose of prolonging the tenure or survival of political leaders and similar to the economic component the political component also acknowledges a discriminatory dynamic. The new or continued enforcement of property rights will tend to favor actors of whom political leaders rely on for political survival. The expropriation of property will be towards actors that are either a threat or do not aid political survival. Finally, the redistribution of property, taking from one actor to give to another, integrates the components of expropriating property and creating new rights. 

By acknowledging the dynamics of both components it is now possible to specify these observations and further explain the role of expropriation with the purpose of answering the question: *how do expropriation strategies shape property rights enforcement in developing states?* 

Developing states lack state capacity and the political leaders of respective countries aim to implement policies that allow for them to see increases in its control over territory, economy, and transportation. Control over these three aspects of a country ultimately influence state capacity, now that it is the ability for states to both gather revenue and use this revenue for the provision of public goods (Candela 2020). There is a bidirectional relationship between property rights and state capacity. Enforcing property rights allows for the ability of particular individuals to participate in economic decision making, see increases in wealth and this creates an increase in government revenue. This government revenue can then be used to provide public goods, expand the use of state power by political leaders to enforce laws, and allow for the enforcement of property rights for more individuals. 

However, the starting point for developing states is one where property rights are only enforced to a certain extent and more representative of a private over a public good, due to the economic and political components of discriminatory property right enforcement. Given that political leaders of developing states aim to see increases in government revenue and prolong their time in power they aim to implement policies with the purpose of expanding and increasing state capacity. Due to this political leaders will make long term investments in the institutions necessary for the development of state capacity, but these processes may be interrupted by political instability (Besley and Persson 2009), and risk of conflict from domestic and international actors (Besley and Persson 2010). 

This paper argues and make the case that since political leaders of developing states aim to increase state capacity, they will expropriate property with the ultimate goal of limiting interruptions to the development of state capacity. The discriminatory dynamic of property right enforcement plays a role in how political leaders will expropriate property and from this it is possible to make the following three theoretical claims. 

The first, $Claim_1$, *political leaders will expropriate property in a discriminatory manner with the purpose of developing their respective states and allowing for greater state capacity*. Expropriation is strategic action and political leaders will expropriate when they perceive that there is a better use of property when it comes to increasing control over national territory or to increase flows of government revenue. 

Since political leaders aim to increase control over their national territory it may be possible to make the following claim, $Claim_2$, *political leaders will confiscate property relative to how much they rely on a private actor for political survival*. The logic behind this claim is fairly simple - private actors can punish or resist political leaders for expropriating their property, since  political leaders aim to remain in power and if expropriating from a group or individual necessary for political survival then this risks both political tenure and political stability. However both punishment and resisting comes at a cost, if the cost of resisting or punishing the political leaders outweighs the benefits of future income from the good being expropriated these actors will not oppose state expropriation, but if the cost of resisting is less than the benefit then there is the potential for these actors to interrupt the political stability necessary for the development of state capacity. 

This is visible in Mexico during the *Porfiriato* or under Porfirio Diaz (1876-1911), where if private individuals did not have proof of ownership land was both expropriated and redistributed. Since Porfirio Diaz did not rely on rural and indigenous people for political survival then his expropriation strategy consisted in confiscating from these groups and redistributing to foreign capitalists. A similar dynamic is visible after the *Porfiriato*, following the exile of Porfirio Diaz (1911), the Mexican revolution (1910-1920), and the establishment of the *Partido Nacional Revolucionario* (PNR) - Mexican political leaders transitioned from favoring foreign interests to those of working class and rural portions of the population. Given this transition and political leaders no longer relying or attempting to appeal to foreign interest, the large scale expropriation and nationalization by Lazaro Cardenas (1934-1940) of oil owned by United States firms became possible (1938).

Considering that if political leaders expropriate their expropriation is relative to the private actor  necessary for political survival - expropriation is bound to lead to redistribution, either from one private actor to another, or from the private actor to the state. However, if expropriation and strategies of redistribution do not lead to an increase in state capacity - whether through an increase in government revenue or centralization of power, then political leaders will be forced to either further redistribute or restore confiscated property. From this observation it is possible to make the third claim, $Claim_3$, *political leaders will restore or continue to redistribute property if initial expropriation does not allow for further development of state capacity*. 

## Case Selection 

Boettke, Coyne, and Leeson (2013) observe that when studying political economy there are strengths to 1. studying historical and qualitative data, as well as 2. applying this evidence within a comparative perspective. The use of historical and qualitative data acknowledges that "...behavior, organizations, and policies never exist in a vacuum but always within a broader social context" (298). With the broader social context being within a span of time and in relation to other societies, cultures, and countries. Skarbek (2020) builds on these arguments by noting the strengths of qualitative methods that take into account 1. time and 2. the strengths of the comparative case studies; the former takes into account the evolution of institutions and processes across time, while the latter allows for the rich study of causal processes across cases; both allowing for thick over thin conceptualization and concept explanation. 

Seminal literature on property rights, such as Demsetz (1967), North and Thomas (1973), Libecap (1989), and Pejovich (1990), adopt either one or both of these features. Noting that property rights evolve and are dependent on particular institutional features, as well as the importance of comparing the property rights of particular societies within different periods of time, as well as across time. In a similar vein to the classical literature more recent work on property rights, not only embraces the use of qualitative data, but take on a comparative and evolutionary approach (Piano and Salter 2020; Albertus 2020; Murtazashvili and Murtazashvili 2021). 

As a region Latin America's unique history creates a space for better understanding the role of property rights and its interaction with political institutions. The Conquista and colonial Latin America provide insight into how economic incentives of both the Crown and Spanish *encomendados* and *hacendados* influenced Spain's hegemony and political influence in both Europe and Latin America (Grafe and Irigoin 2012), 19th century liberal reforms demonstrate how property ownership influenced the emergence and strength of democratic institutions (Yashar 1997; Mahoney 2002), and 20th century land reform provide insight into the paradox of political exclusion in autocracies but large scale redistribution for increased economic participation (Albertus 2015; 2020).

Any analysis of expropriation in Latin America interacts with the legacy of property rights under the *Conquista* and Spanish colonization, the legacy of 19th century liberalization on political outcomes, and either how it led to land reform, was observed with land reform, and the consequences of it. However, where the analysis of Guatemala, and the comparative analysis of expropriation under Estrada Cabrera and Ubico contributes to the literature is due to the following. 

The two major differences between studying Guatemala under Estrada Cabrera and Guatemala under Jorge Ubico are differences in time with the former being in $T_1$ and the latter being in $T_2$. However, the strengths in analyzing these two regimes are that both political leaders came to power as a response to economic crises, with Estrada Cabrera as a response to X and Jorge Ubico to Y. They both were in power during periods of war with Estrada Cabrera being in power during WWI and Jorge Ubico during WWII. Their economies varied very little with government revenue being highly reliant on both export and import taxes, beginning both regimes on good terms with Guatemalan immigrants due to reliance on their connections with European markets, but witnessing declines in exports during the World Wars. Finally, despite reliance on German immigrants towards the beginning of their regimes - eventually expropriating German property. The wide array of similarities create a strong case for most similar case analysis (Gerring 2017, 41) and avoiding the noise and variability that limits the strength of using case studies as a method (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 214-216).



1. Strengths of case analysis
  - Minimize noise and variability between variables (KKV 214-216)
  - Most-similar case selection, where we observe similarities on Z and similarities on Y (Gerring 41)
  - Same country across different points of time
  - Rise of political leaders in time of crisis
  - Positive change in state capacity (qualitatively)
  - World Wars that force it to interact with competing interests
    - Guatemala 
    - United States
2. - $H_1$: Observe land policy, creation, expropriation and redistribution of property rights. 
  - $H_2$: Should be able to observe expropriation relative to the following: 
    - Relative German exports
      - Increasing German exports - decreased expropriation 
      - Decreasing German exports - increased expropriation
